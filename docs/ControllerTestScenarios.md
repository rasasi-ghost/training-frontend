# High-Level Controller Test Scenarios

## Overview
This document outlines high-level test scenarios for the application's controllers. These scenarios focus on functionality verification and key user flows rather than implementation details.

## UserController

### Authentication
1. **User Login Flow**
   - Successfully login with valid credentials
   - Handle invalid credentials with appropriate error messages
   - Verify token storage and user state updates

2. **User Logout Flow**
   - Successfully log out and clear user state
   - Handle logout errors gracefully

3. **Registration Flows**
   - Register student with complete information
   - Register teacher with complete information
   - Handle duplicate email registrations
   - Verify role-specific behavior (student auto-login vs teacher pending approval)

### Profile Management
1. **Profile Operations**
   - Retrieve user profile data
   - Update profile information
   - Change password
   - Handle unauthenticated requests appropriately

### Role-Based Access
1. **Authorization Checks**
   - Verify admin-only functions are protected
   - Test role-based redirection
   - Validate session management

## CoursesController

### Course Management
1. **Dashboard Data**
   - Load all required course data
   - Correctly categorize courses (available, enrolled, pending, completed)
   - Handle loading states

2. **Enrollment**
   - Successfully enroll in available courses
   - Check enrollment status for specific courses
   - Access course-specific enrollment details

3. **Course Status Tracking**
   - Verify pending courses list
   - Verify approved courses list
   - Verify completed courses list

## TeacherCourseController

### Teacher Status
1. **Approval Flow**
   - Check teacher approval status
   - Handle different approval states (approved, pending, rejected)

### Course Creation and Management
1. **Course Operations**
   - Create new courses with required information
   - Update existing course details
   - Retrieve teacher's courses
   - Get detailed information for specific courses

2. **Lecture Management**
   - Add lectures to courses
   - Update lecture information
   - Delete lectures
   - Retrieve all lectures for a course

### Student Management
1. **Enrollment Management**
   - View enrollments for specific courses
   - Update enrollment status (approve/reject)
   - Assign grades to enrolled students

## AdminUsecasesController

### User Management
1. **User Operations**
   - List all users in the system
   - Get detailed information for specific users
   - Create new users with specific roles
   - Update user roles
   - Delete users

### Teacher Application Management
1. **Teacher Approval**
   - List pending teacher applications
   - Approve teacher applications
   - Reject teacher applications

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests
Focus on testing individual controller methods in isolation:
- Mock dependencies (stores, services)
- Test success and error paths
- Verify correct store interactions

### Integration Tests
Verify interactions between controllers and stores:
- Test data flow between components
- Verify state updates
- Test error handling and recovery

### End-to-End Tests
Cover key user flows:
- Student registration and course enrollment
- Teacher registration, approval, and course creation
- Admin user management and teacher approval

## Test Scenarios by User Role

### Student User
1. Register account
2. Browse available courses
3. Enroll in courses
4. Track enrollment status
5. View approved and completed courses
6. Update profile information

### Teacher User
1. Register account
2. Await approval status
3. Create and manage courses
4. Add and update lectures
5. Manage student enrollments
6. Grade enrolled students

### Admin User
1. Manage all users (create, update, delete)
2. Approve or reject teacher applications
3. Monitor system activity

## Test Data Requirements

- **User Accounts**: Various roles (student, teacher, admin)
- **Courses**: In different states (available, pending approval, active, completed)
- **Enrollments**: With different statuses (pending, approved, completed)
- **Lectures**: Associated with different courses

## Test Environment Considerations

- **Authentication**: Mock Firebase authentication
- **API Responses**: Mock backend API responses
- **State Management**: Verify store updates
- **Local Storage**: Test token storage and retrieval
